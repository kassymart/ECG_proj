Application name: Simple Shimmer App
This project is UNDER PROGRESS! 
Contents contains a smartphone application for the device Shimmer3 ECG that contains three electrodes: (Left Arm, Right Arm),
(Left Arm, Left Leg), (Right Arm, Left Leg) to detect stress in an individual. 
Right now, the app can read some CSV files from a MATLAB model (created by Robert Burns) that will display the accelerometer
graphs of the three electrodes along with a table view of the data points of the three electrodes. 
Future plans to this projects features a Bluetooth or equivalent connection to the smartphone application in order to control
the streaming of the device and as well as enabling a real-time stress detection on the smartphone application. 
For more details on the application, here's a link to the report
